			He climbed the construction site as if it were solid,
			He built in the landing four magical walls,
			Brick by brick in a logical design,
			His eyes dulled by the concrete and traffic,
			He sat down to rest as though he were a prince,
			He ate beans and rice as if it were the best,
			He drank and sobbed as if he were a machine,
			He danced and laughed as if he were the next one,
			And he stumbled in the sky as though listening to music,
			And he floated in the air as if it were Saturday...

			<br><br>
			When I look back, boy, I must have been green
			Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
			Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
			Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind
			They said, get back, honky cat
			Better get back to the woods
			Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
			And, oh, change is gonna do me good
			You better get back, honky cat
			Living in the city ain't where it's at
			It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
			It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine
			Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
			About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
			And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
			They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule
			They said, get back, honky cat
			Better get back to the woods
			Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
			And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
			You better get back, honky cat
			Living in the city ain't where it's at
			It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
			It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine
			They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
			Living in the city, son, is gonna break your heart
			But how can you stay when your heart says no
			Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go
			You better get back, honky cat
			Better get back to the woods
			Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
			And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
			You better get back, honky cat
			Living in the city ain't where it's at
			It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
			It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine
